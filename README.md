## WISH ME! App
---
#### Project Overview – 
The Wishlist App is a personalized shopping wishlist manager that allows users to save clothing and accessories from any online store by simply pasting a link. The app automatically extracts product details, including images, material, and price, and organizes them into custom sections—similar to Pinterest boards.
**How It Works:**

* Paste a product link from any e-commerce website.

* The app extracts images, material, price, and details automatically.

* Organize wishlists into sections based on brands, occasions, or personal preferences.

* Access and manage your wishlist anytime from mobile or web.

The app is designed to be fast, modern, and user-friendly, making it the perfect tool for organizing fashion choices across multiple online stores. Future features will include price tracking, AI-based outfit suggestions, and sharing wishlists with friends.

#### Vision & Motivation –                                                 

##### Why This Project?

In today's fast-paced online shopping world, people often come across clothing and accessories they love but aren’t ready to purchase immediately. Traditional wishlists on e-commerce sites are limited to a single platform, making it difficult to organize and compare products from different stores. 
This app solves that problem by allowing users to curate a personal wishlist from any online store in one place.

##### The Vision

Our goal is to create a centralized, visually appealing, and highly personalized wishlist app that seamlessly integrates with users' shopping experiences. Instead of juggling between multiple store wishlists, users can paste links to their favorite clothing items, and the app will automatically extract relevant details like images, fabric material, and pricing.

##### Key Benefits

✅ Universal Wishlist – No restrictions on where you shop; add items from any website.
✅ Personalized Organization – Create different sections based on brands, occasions, or personal preferences.
✅ Easy Access & Sharing – Quickly retrieve saved items and share wishlists with friends.
✅ Future Enhancements – Price tracking, smart recommendations, and AI-based outfit suggestions.

This project isn’t just about organizing shopping lists; it’s about enhancing the way people discover, save, and manage their fashion choices.
